      <h2> Most Soils consist of the following...</h2>
<div class="data">

  <h3>Peat Moss</h3>


      <p>
      The primary ingredient in most potting soils is sphagnum peat moss. <br> <br>

        Sphagnum peat moss is well-draining and well-aerated, but it’s very low in available
        nutrients and it has an acidic pH, typically ranging between 3.5 and 4.5. Limestone
        is added to peat-based potting mixes to help balance the pH. I use bales of Premier
        brand peat moss for my homemade potting soil, blended with crushed limestone at a
        rate of 1/4 cup lime for every 6 gallons of peat moss. <br>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h3>Pearlite</h3>
      <p>Perlite is a mined, volcanic rock. When it’s heated, it expands, making perlite
         particles look like small, white balls of Styrofoam. Perlite is a lightweight,
         sterile addition to bagged and homemade potting mixes. <br> <br>

         It holds three to four times its weight in water, increases pore space,
         and improves drainage. With a neutral pH, perlite is easy to find at
         nurseries and garden centers. One popular brand of perlite is Espoma perlite. <br>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h3>Coir Fiber</h3>
      <p>Vermiculite is a mined mineral that is conditioned by heating until it expands into
        light particles. It’s used to increase the porosity of commercial and DIY potting soil
         mixes. In potting soil, vermiculite also adds calcium and magnesium, and increases
         the mix’s water-holding capacity. <br> <br>

         Though asbestos contamination was once a concern with vermiculite, mines are now
         regulated and regularly tested. Organic bagged vermiculite is my favorite source. <br>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h3>Sand</h3>
      <p>Coarse sand improves drainage and adds weight to potting mixes. Mixes formulated for cacti
        and other succulents tend to have a higher percentage of coarse sand in their composition to
        ensure ample drainage. <br> <a href="https://savvygardening.com/diy-potting-soil/"><em> Savy Gardener</em></a></p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h3>Limestone</h3>
      <p>Add pulverized calcitic limestone or dolomitic limestone  to peat-based potting soils
         to neutralize their pH. Use about 1/4 cup for every 6 gallons of peat moss. These
         minerals are mined from natural deposits and are readily available and inexpensive.
         Jobe’s is a good brand of lime for use in DIY potting soil.<br>
